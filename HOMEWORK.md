# Homework

During the devcamp we'll be assigning homework for the next sessions and this document is here to explain how this would work.

## Structure

Every session's code would be published in a separate branch in this repository and will be merged into the master branch when we progress to the next session. This structure would allow us to allow clean pull requests for the particular session.

## How to find assignments

All homework assignments would be marked by a commentary `// TODO:` so you can search the code for these. This would make it easier for you to find a starting point for writing the homework code.

Code is located at this repository in the `dna/course/zomes/courses/code/src/` folder. Search contents of this folder for `//TODO:` to get all homework assignments.

## How to submit

Fork this repository and start writing your homework for the branch you want to work on. Once you have the code you're willing to show, create a pull request for this repository (you can find more about how to do that in [GitHub official guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)).

Please note that we will not be merging any of the pull requests. They will be only used as a comfortable collaboration tool for code review.

When submitting your PR, please mention any questions about your code explicitly to help the code reviewers understand your goals.

## When you've done all the homework

Our Holochain Devcamp is a community organized event, so we encourage you to help us do code reviews of other participants and learn more yourself by explaining things you've already understood.
